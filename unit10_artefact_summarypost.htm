Post</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My initial post compared the EU's General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) and the Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information
(APPI).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Both the GDPR and the APPI share
the fundamental objective of safeguarding individuals' personal data and
exhibit certain similarities and differences in their principles, rights and
enforcement mechanisms. Both laws establish guidelines for the lawful collection,
use, processing and storage of personal information. They also grant data
subjects specific rights. Furthermore, data security measures must be
implemented by organisations to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure or
destruction of personal data. Consent from data subjects is also a shared
requirement in both the GDPR and the APPI for data collection and processing.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Notable differences between the
two laws were also examined in the Initial Post. The GDPR specifies specific
legal bases for lawful data processing, including consent, contract
performance, legal obligations, vital interests, public task and legitimate
interests. In contrast, the APPI does not outline legal bases as explicitly as
the GDPR.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>An essential distinction lies in
the scope of applicability. While the GDPR does not pertain to anonymised data,
the APPI does, even if re-identification of data subjects is not possible.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The implementation of data security measures such as
anonymisation is of utmost importance; however, it also entails considerable
implications concerning the trade-off between levels of data protection and
data utility. Prioritising considerations of re-identification risks, however,
should remain a key focus, when collecting and processing personal data for
business or research purposes which must be firmly supported with lawful bases.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>Comparing these legal frameworks
emphasises the universal concept of the relationship between humans and
machines, despite the local variations in laws. Such analysis sheds light on
the human-centric considerations of human dignity concerning personal data (Miyashita,
2021).</p>

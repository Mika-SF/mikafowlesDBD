							<h1>Individual contribution to the Team Project 1</h1>
							<p>For the Team Project 1, I worked in Group 2 and we produced a database design proposal for a student data management system at a fictional education sector. One of my contributions in this project is proposing and conducting a user survey at my current workplace which is a UK higher education provider, as this is an effective method of fact finding, which enabled us to contextualise realistic challenges faced by the current student data management system for our client and to propose solutions with a new system.<p/>
              <p>I made a significant contribution by researching and writing for Data control issues in the section called Requirement of the database model design. In addition, I wrote the section called Proposal of the database management system (DBMS). Both of these are presented below.<p/>
              <p><b>Data control issues</b><p/>
              <p>Some crucial data control issues are security, backup and recovery, and concurrency control (Gillenson, 2011). Data security requirements include: user authentication, authorisation and encryption. The student data contains personal details of vulnerable individuals (under 18 and/or with disabilities). Given the sensitive nature of data, compliance requirements, such as GDPR, must be adhered to. Reliable data backup and recovery must also be part of the data management system. In the multi-user environment at Uni Prep Ltd. where users attempt to access the same data simultaneously, the database model must be designed in such a way that data updates will not interfere with multi-user transactions.</p>
              <p><b>Proposal of the database management system (DBMS)</b><p/>
              <p>Our proposed database model design involves the relational database management system (RDBMS). Compared to other types of DBMS such as the hierarchical and network approaches which require navigation through the hierarchy or network of stored data to be able to find specific data in question (Gillenson, 2011), the RDBMS presents several advantages including simplicity and flexibility. The RDBMS has been in increasing use in the past four decades (Hassan, 2021) and its data structure allows reliable and efficient transactions, which would be ideal for the requirements of Uni Prep Ltd.
Based on this, our proposed database management system is Microsoft Azure. 
Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft. This online portal offers reliable and scalable Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) on a pay-as-you-go basis, which makes it a flexible and cost-effective solution. Furthermore, several aspects in data security are covered, e.g., network security, access management, threat protection and information protection (Microsoft, 2023a). Azure also complies with various privacy regulations including the GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001 (Microsoft, 2023b). Azure SQL database allows users to extract specific information using an XML-based query (Chao, 2013).

							<h1>Reflection on the learning from this module</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In this module <b>Deciphering Big Data</b>, we explored different data types, formats, sources, structures and various methods of data collection. We looked at practical processes of data wrangling and surrounding issues of consideration such as legal and compliance issues involving the handling of personal information and challenges of dealing with a vast amount of unstructured data, as well as how procedures such as data cleaning and normalisation allow us to transform data to more usable and less redundant formats.</p>
							<p><b>1. Individual learning from the module content</b></p>
							<p>Specific challenges for me in the learning regarding data wrangling were various technical details. There were a number of technical concepts and skills to learn, such as Python, html, GitHub, different types of database management systems (DBMSs), which were new to me, and it was often a time-consuming process especially when combinations of knowledge of these were required. However, by exploring an extensive amount of reading and learning activities assigned across different Units, I felt increasingly better-informed and more competent with different concepts and processes involving data extraction, exploration, cleaning and modelling techniques. I felt that, the initial stage of learning new concepts or skills was the hardest and it required a great deal of patience. As more pieces of new information became familiar, the learning process developed more steadily and effectively.</p>
							<p>There were also certain topics which I was already familiar with, such as data structure, data types, data formats, data cleaning in the context of Huxley (2020) and legal and compliance requirements, as these were relevant in my previous professional experience involving the processing of big data for research purposes. Having such knowledge facilitated my learning of new concepts and skills covered in this module.</p>
							<p><b>2. My learning from the team project learning experience</b></p>
							<p>In addition to individual learning activities directly related to each topic in this module, there were two group projects in which we incorporated our knowledge and skills acquired throughout the module learning and applied them to produce a database management proposal and an executive summary. As will be discussed below in detail, the group learning components added further depth and dimensions to my learning experience. </p>
							<p><b>2.1. Description of the team projects</b></p>
							<p>I worked in Group 2 with the two other team members, Nick Bandy and Ruth Allison. Nick is a technical expert who is experienced in inspecting data items, examining logical data structures and building relational databases. Ruth has project management skills backed up with her professional project management experience and relevant academic qualification. My expertise is strong research abilities and data analysis skills, supported by my experience of conducting research for my PhD and subsequent academic studies in the Brain Science areas as well as my professional experience as a lecturer. Thus, our group consisted of various expertise required for accomplishing the group projects and I was very excited about this.</p>
							<p>For the first team project, we needed to construct a proposal to our real-life or fictional client regarding a new design of their database management system. We decided to select a fictional UK education provider named Uni Prep Ltd as our client and their student data management system as our topic, as both Ruth and I happen to work in the same education provider in the UK and we thought our familiarity with data requirements, data utility and relevant legal requirements would be useful in developing our project.</p>
							<p>Specifically, the first team project required us to design a single logical database and report it as a proposal to our client. Our proposal discussed user details and specific data requirements, including data types and formats and data concurrency details. Relevant data management pipeline was described and a specific database model design and a proposed DBMS (Microsoft Azure) were discussed. </p>
							<p>The second team project was based on this proposal. We completed the database design, critically evaluated strengths and limitations of different database models, built and presented the proposed database and examined legal and compliance requirements applicable to the UK education provider for their collection and processing of personal data.</p>
							<p><b>2.2. My individual contribution to the team projects 1 & 2</b></p>
							<p>My major contribution to the team project 1 was to conduct research on relational DBMSs and specifically regarding Microsoft Azure to discuss why it would provide a reliable and effective solution for our client. I wrote a relevant draft, discussed my thoughts and details in the draft with my team members during our weekly online meetings and completed the final draft for this section.</p>
							<p>Prior to this, I was not familiar with concepts and technical details of DBMSs and was quite apprehensive about whether I could learn about them in time and write up concisely but effectively. Therefore, I started my research straightaway and consulted a wide range of sources, including module resources, textbooks and external web sources. I found the module Unit content relevant and useful, particularly in Unit 8 and Unit 9. Examining and understanding my team members’ output for their assigned items was also helpful as they are all related.</p>
							<p>For the team project 2, my major individual contribution concerned the area regarding legal and compliance requirements for the handling of personal data by our client. As mentioned, I have a strong background and knowledge in this aspect, which helped me carry out required research focused on this topic and produce the first draft very quickly and effectively. I shared it in our digital workspace (on Teams) and developed the final draft by making it consistent with my team members’ outputs. As I was efficient in this role, I proactively conducted additional literature search for other sections and uploaded a list of additional academic sources to Teams’ workspace. I feel that, as we progressed through the two team projects, I got more used to working under time pressure, making use of my limited time while working full-time and having family members to look after and applying methodical approaches in order to achieve goals. Talking to my team members at weekly meetings and specifying next action plans was also greatly helpful, as this means it further clarified what I needed to do by the next meeting and motivated me to work through my busy schedule.</p>
							<p><b>2.3. Evaluation of our collaboration as a team</b></p>
							<p>We made very effective use of weekly online meetings as well as the digital workspace using Teams. I think this helped us develop our ideas and draft sections regularly, by uploading written materials to the shared folder, communicating through chat functions and discussing issues, solutions, goals and important details. Considering the time difference (Ruth and myself in the UK and Nick in Canada), our daily work and family commitment plus our regular study workload for ongoing Units, this arrangement worked very well. </p>
							<p>Our specific challenges during the two team projects include understanding some details in the specific context of task requirements. We explored our thoughts, discussed the module content and seminar recordings as well as assessment instructions together. We also felt that the word limit was tight for what we wanted to include and what was expected from the assessment instructions. Our solution to this was to firstly produce what we considered necessary in detail and then to make it more concise. </p>
							<p>Another particular challenge was the change from Microsoft Azure to SQLite as a proposed DBMS. I think this is because of my limited technical knowledge in this area. My individual contribution for the first project was based on Azure and I was initially anxious that my research for the second team project may not be efficient. However, this actually helped me to learn more than initially planned and did not hinder my productivity in the second project, as discussed earlier.</p>
							<p>I was very happy in working in this group with highly motivated, conscientious and very professional team members. We were very supportive and encouraging to each other throughout the collaboration. I think we worked efficiently from the beginning, but as we got to know each other better over time, our collaboration developed to even more effective approaches by regularly identifying and agreeing on concrete targets and honestly sharing our feelings about the tasks and progress. </p>
							<p><b>2.4. My experience as a member of a development team</b></p>
							<p>In addition to acquiring more understanding of technical and theoretical aspects of the academic topics, working collaboratively with team members who have various expertise allowed me to develop different approaches to learning including how to find or allocate time during the busy schedule, the importance of identifying effective but realistic goals and keeping the big picture of targets in mind. </p>
							<p>This collaborative experience also made me become more aware of my own skillset including strengths and weaknesses, which helped setting next goals and figuring out what is required specifically for myself to achieve these goals as well as having a clearer grasp of how and where my strengths can be utilised in a group setting.</p>
							<p>Moreover, I feel that the team work experience enabled me stretch myself beyond what I thought possible, as I wanted to meet the group’s expectations and keep up with their high motivation. I was determined to make positive contributions through my current knowledge/skills as well as through ongoing learning, and this helped me keep going with my individual commitment with the module too.</p>
							<p>I also learned that sometimes I need to remind myself of expressing my knowledge and strengths more explicitly to others. I was aware that this was always something I tend to underperform partly due to my cultural background, originally coming from the collectivistic culture rather than the individualistic culture. However, the Peer Evaluation element as part of the grading scheme for the two team projects led me to reflect on this much more consciously. Moving forward, I will keep this experience and realisation in mind and take more explicit actions to express my strengths and expertise in collaborative work settings.</p>
							<p><b>2.5. Impact on my professional/personal development</b></p>
							<p>One of the clearest impacts on my professional development is my first-hand experience of various emotions students feel during their academic development, for instance, feeling anxious about time pressure, feeling of struggles or the proud feeling when finally figuring something out or achieving goals. I also felt that the module structure and content together with assessment details have a direct influence on students’ learning. It also became even clearer that learning materials and assessments should be constructed to enable the learning for students with different levels of academic knowledge and skills. In the future, I will endeavour to consider these aspects in my teaching as well as developing learning/assessment materials.</p>
							<p>Another notable impact on my professional development is that I realised there are much more connections between cognitive science and data science. In particular, the content in Unit 12 regarding Artificial Intelligence was intriguing and I could see various intersections between them. This final Unit leads nicely to the next module regarding Artificial Intelligence but unfortunately the current module is the last one for me as I am studying for the PG Cert programme. I will definitely continue examining AI-related topics and explore possible interdisciplinary research areas. </p>
							<p>On a personal level, the biggest impact is to find sheer joy of being able to learn exciting areas. Finding there is so much more to learn can be overwhelming at times but I was more fascinated by newly learned concepts and technical details. I learned to conduct critical evaluation of targets and processes, especially when facing a large amount of information processing to prepare for assigned tasks. In addition, learning not on my own but in the peer group (mostly with the same individuals for the duration of the three modules) provided a sense of belonging and allowed me to be more active and competitive in learning. Peers from different academic/professional backgrounds helped me realise various perspectives, which enriched my learning experience. </p>
							<p>To conclude, it was a highly intensive, challenging but fulfilling experience which was well worth the effort. I am grateful for this stimulating and enjoyable academic journey.</p>

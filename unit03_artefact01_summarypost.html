							<h1>Collaborative Discussion: The Data Collection Process - Summary Post</h1>
							<p>By actively working together with my peers, I gained valuable insights into the unique aspects of IoT data, allowing me to better understand the opportunities and challenges involved in managing and analysing large-scale datasets.<p/>
              <p>My Initial Post discussed that the multi-faceted nature of IoT data and their variation of types/formats pose challenges for data scientists (Cai et al., 2017). A peer agreed on this, pointing out that the volume and variety of data generated by IoT devices can have adverse effects on ensuring data accuracy, reliability and consistency. Moreover, it was emphasised by this peer that such poor data quality has further consequences including poor decision making and inaccurate insights. <p/>
              <p>Whilst such limitations are often acknowledged, positive impacts of IoT data on business have also been highlighted, referring to IoT as ‘a key enabler for business digitalization’ with the potential to create intelligent environments capable of revolutionising structures, processes and services (Sestino et al., 2020). <p/>
              <p>My Initial Post also described the significance of acknowledging the objectives and purposes behind data analysis. This awareness serves as a driving force to comprehend the implications of missing values, errors, and data anomalies, allowing us to make informed decisions on how to appropriately cleanse the data (Huxley, 2020).</p>
              <p>Expanding on the argument presented by Talha et al. (2019) regarding the conflict between data quality and data security in big data environments, another peer contributed to the discussion, shedding light on the challenges arising from the extensive volume and diverse nature of IoT data, coupled with the rapid pace at which the data is generated.</p>
              <p>More specifically, IoT systems were illustrated as high security risks due to lack of well-defined parameters and the heterogeneity of devices (Bertino, 2016). It was further suggested that, in order to mitigate this conflict, organisations can employ various measures such as data classification, governance, and privacy protocols to safeguard the data while simultaneously preserving its quality (ISO/IEC, 2019).</p>

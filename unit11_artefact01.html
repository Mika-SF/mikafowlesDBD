							<h1>Individual contribution to the Team Project 2: Legal and Compliance Requirements</h1>
							<p>For the Team Project 2, I continued working in Group 2 and we produced the Executive Summary based on our proposal (Team Project 1) of a database design for a student data management system at a fictional education sector. My major individual contribution is to conduct extensive research on legal and compliance requirements applicable to UK education providers and to write up the relevant section as shown below.</p>
              <p><b>Legal and Compliance Requirements</b></p>
              <p>Given the nature of the data collected and processed at Uni Prep Ltd, we recognise the importance of the data protection and secure handling of personal data. As we propose a new database solution for Uni Prep Ltd, it is essential to consider the legal and compliance requirements applied to education sectors in the UK to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of personal information. In this section, we will outline the key considerations in this respect. </p>
              <p><i><b>Data protection laws</b></i></p>
              <p>In the UK, the primary legislation governing data protection is the Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR). Following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union (EU), the EU GDPR is no longer applicable in the UK but its core data protection principles have been incorporated into UK law as the UK GDPR (ICO, n.d.). The DPA 2018 controls how personal information is used by organisations and implements the UK GDPR (UK Government, n.d.).</p>
              <p>These regulations establish the rights and obligations of data controllers and processors, ensuring that personal data is processed lawfully and transparently. Our database proposal therefore includes adherence to these regulations to safeguard the privacy of students and staff at Uni Prep Ltd.</p>
              <p><i><b>Lawful basis for processing personal data</b></i></p>
              <p>According to the UK Government (2020), personal data for education providers include (but is not limited to): </p>
              <ul>
                <li>contact information about students, guardians and staff</li>
                <li>health information</li>
                <li>safeguarding information</li>
                <li>passport information</li>
                <li>exam results</li>                
              </ul>
             <p>As set out in Article 6 in the UK GDPR, the processing of personal data must have a lawful basis. For this reason, it is crucial to obtain consent from data subjects and fulfil a contract.</p>
             <p><i><b>Individual rights</b></i></p>
             <p>Individuals whose data is being processed by education providers have various rights, including the right to be informed, right to access, right to rectification, right to erasure, right to restrict processing, right to data portability, right to object, and rights related to automated decision-making and profiling (ICO, n.d.).</p>
             <p><i><b>Data security threats</b></i></p>
             <p>Data security breaches could occur due to different causes e.g., intercepted communications, computer viruses, and unauthorised access (Gillenson, 2011). To mitigate such risks, it is of paramount importance that various data security measures are employed.</p>
             <p>With respect to the use of SQLite, key data security considerations are as follows: </p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Access control:</b> It should be noted that SQLite does not provide support for user-level access control. As such, we recommend implementing user authentication and authorization systems.</li>
                <li><b>Encryption: </b>SQLite client library does not support encrypting database files by default. Therefore, it is recommended to use a custom version of SQLite with encryption extensions such as the SQLite Encryption Extension (SEE) (SQLite, 2023). It is noteworthy that Article 32 of the UK GDPR specifies encryption as one of the appropriate technical measures for data security.</li>
                <li><b>Backup: </b>To avoid loss of data, we recommend utilising backup solutions. In SQLite, the whole database can be saved as a file by using the .backup function (Kreibich, 2010).</li>
             </ul>
              <p><i><b>Standards</b></i></p>
              <p>To further ensure data security, employee training on good security practices should be conducted. It is also recommended for Uni Prep Ltd to aim to achieve ISO/IEC 27001, which is an internationally recognised standard for information security management system. Certification with ISO/IEC 27001 is thought to facilitate organisations’ GDPR compliance (Lopes et al., 2019).</p>
              <p>Ensuring legal compliance and data protection is a fundamental aspect of our database proposal. We recommend aligning data governance with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR by incorporating data minimization, lawful basis, and robust security measures to maximize data security.</p>

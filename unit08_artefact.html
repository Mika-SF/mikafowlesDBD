							<h1>Collaborative Discussion 2: Comparing Compliance Laws - Initial Post</h1>
							<p>In Japan, the data protection law called the Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) was firstly adopted in 2003 (PPI, n.d.). The APPI is formally reviewed every three years to identify any required updates. Following some high-profile data breaches, the amended APPI with major updates came into force in 2017. This was one year earlier than the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into effect in May 2018. Most recent amendments to the APPI introduced additional regulation of cross-border data transfer and came into force in 2020.<p/>
              <p>The GDPR and the APPI are both data protection laws that aim to safeguard individuals' personal data and share some similarities and differences in their principles, rights and enforcement.<p/>
              <p>Regarding similarities, both regulations establish rules for the lawful collection, use, processing and storage of personal information. In addition, they both grant certain rights to data subjects, such as the right to access their data, the right to erasure, the right to correct inaccuracies and the right to request the suspension or deletion of their data. Furthermore, both regulations impose obligations to organisations to notify relevant authorities and affected individuals in case of a data breach which could affect their rights and freedom. Also, another similarity concerning data protection is that, under both regulations, organisations are required to implement data security measures to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure or destruction. Both the GDPR and the APPI enforce organisations to obtain data subjects’ consent when collecting and processing their personal data.<p/>
              <p>As for the differences, whilst the APPI is applicable to personal data handled by organisations which operate in Japan, the EU GDPR applies to the processing of personal data in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). Notably, the APPI only applies to business organisations; other operators such as local governments and independent administrative agencies fall under different regulations and are exempt from the APPI (Coos, 2022).</p>
              <p>Another difference is that, the GDPR provides specific legal bases for lawful data processing, including consent, contract performance, legal obligations, vital interests, public task and legitimate interests, whereas the APPI does not specify legal bases as clearly as the GDPR (OneTrust DataGuidance, n.d.).</p>
              <p>Crucially, whilst the GDPR does not apply to anonymised data, the APPI is applicable to anonymously processed data, even if re-identification of data subjects is not possible (OneTrust DataGuidance, n.d.).</p>
              <p>As Miyashita (2021, p.1) notes, ‘the basic idea of the relationship between humans and machines is universal, even if the laws are local, in bridging the different legal regimes’. Thus, comparisons between different legal frameworks would illuminate the ‘human-centric considerations of human dignity’ (Miyashita, 2021, p.6) concerning personal data.   </p>
